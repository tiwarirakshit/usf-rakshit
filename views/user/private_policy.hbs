					<h5 class="ed_toppadder10 ed_bottompadder10">Workplace Safety Policies</h5>
					<p>Whether your business operates in a factory or a standard office complex, anyone who steps onto your
						property faces some level of risk. A data entry worker could develop carpal tunnel syndrome while in
						your employ. Your company vice president could injure himself moving a computer from one office to
						another.</p>
					<h5 class="ed_toppadder10 ed_bottompadder10">Disciplinary Policies</h5>
					<p>Occasionally you'll have the need to terminate an employee. When that occasion arises, you'll have a
						much more straightforward experience if the employee has been cautioned about the process. If your
						expectations for performance are outlined.</p>
					<h5 class="ed_toppadder10 ed_bottompadder10">Device Use Policies</h5>
					<p>You may not realize that as an employer, you could be held responsible for the actions of those in your
						employ. That means if one of your workers conducts illegal activities on one of your systems, you may be
						answerable for it. Businesses protect themselves against liability in these instances by having a
						clearly written usage policy that outlines what workers can and cannot do on devices connected to your
						network.</p>
					<h5 class="ed_toppadder10 ed_bottompadder10"> Work Hours and Turnaround Time</h5>
					<p>In the early days, your policies may relate more to your business processes than your team, since you
						won't have a robust team starting out. One important first step should relate to your availability,
						including your working hours. Studies show that customers prefer talking to live customer service
						representatives. </p>
					<h5 class="ed_toppadder10 ed_bottompadder10">Late Payment Policies</h5>
					<p>Before you do your first job, you should create a payment process for the work you'll perform. How will
						you invoice your clients and what forms of payment will be accepted? Set a grace period for payments to
						be made before a small service charge is added.</p>
					<h5 class="ed_toppadder10 ed_bottompadder10">Return/Refund Policies</h5>
					<p>If your business is a retailer or e-commerce business, you should have a return policy clearly posted
						on your website or store signage. If you put a strict return policy in place, ask yourself whether you
						plan to stand firmly behind that policy or capitulate for those customers who escalate a complaint up
						the chain of command.</p>
					<h5 class="ed_toppadder10 ed_bottompadder10">employee conduct</h5>
					<p>An employee conduct policy establishes the duties and responsibilities each employee must adhere to as
						a condition of employment. Conduct policies are in place as a guideline for appropriate employee
						behavior, and they outline things such as proper dress code, workplace safety procedures, harassment
						policies and policies regarding computer and Internet usage.</p>
					<h5 class="ed_toppadder10 ed_bottompadder10">Equal Opportunity</h5>
					<p>Equal opportunity laws are rules that promote fair treatment in the workplace. Most organizations
						implement equal opportunity policies -- anti-discrimination and affirmative action policies, for example
						-- to encourage unprejudiced behavior within the workplace. These policies discourage inappropriate
						behavior from employees.</p>
